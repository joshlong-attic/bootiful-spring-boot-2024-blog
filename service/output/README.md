:::

Hi, Spring fans! I'm [Josh Long](https://spring.io/team/joshlong), and I
work on the Spring team. I'm a Kotlin GDE and a Java Champion, and I'm
of the opinion that there's never been a better time to be a Java and
Spring Boot developer. I say that fully aware of where we stand in the
span of things today. It's been 21+ years since the earliest releases of
the Spring Framework and 11+ years since the earliest releases of Spring
Boot. This year marks 20 years since the Spring Framework and 10 years
since Spring Boot. So, when I say there's never been a better time to be
a Java and Spring developer, bear in mind I've been in this for the
better part of those decades. I love Java and the JVM, and I love
Spring, and it's been amazing.

But this is the best time. It's never been close. So, let's develop a
new application, as always, by visiting my second favorite place on the
internet, after production,
`start.spring.io`\[<https://start.spring.io>\], and we'll see what I
mean. Click `Add Dependencies` and choose `Web`, `Spring Data JDBC`,
`OpenAI`, `GraalVM Native Support`, `Docker Compose`, `Postgres`, and
`Devtools`.

Give it an artifact name. I called my service... \"service\". I'm great
with names. I get that from my dad. My dad was also amazing with names.
When I was a small boy, we had a tiny little white dog, and my father
named him *White Dog*. He was our family pet for years. But after around
ten years, he disappeared. I'm not sure what became of him after all.
Maybe he got a job; I don't know. But then miraculously, another small
white dog appeared tapping on our home's screen door. So we took him in,
and my father named him *Too*. Or *Two*. I don't know. Anyway, *great*
with names. That said, my mom tells me all the time that I'm very lucky
she named me...​ And, yah, that's probably true.

Anyway, choose Java 21. This part is key. You can't use Java 21 if you
don't use Java 21. So, you need Java 21. But we are also going to use
GraalVM for its native image capabilities.

Don't have Java 21 installed? Download it! Use the fantastic
[SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io) tool: `sdk install java 21-graalce`. And
then make it your default: `sdk default java 21-graalce`. Open a new
shell. Download the `.zip` file.

Java 21 is amazing. It's a far sight better than Java 8. It's
technically superior in every way. It's faster, more robust, more
syntax-rich. It's also morally superior. You won't like the look of
shame and disgrace in your children's eyes when they see you're using
Java 8 in production. Don't do it. Be the change you want to see in the
world. Use Java 21.

You'll get a zip file. Unzip it and open it in your IDE.

I'm using IntelliJ IDEA, and it installs a command-line tool called
`idea`.

``` shell
cd service
idea build.gradlew
# idea pom.xml if you're using Apache Maven
```

If you're using Visual Studio Code, be sure to install the [*Spring Boot
Extension
Pack*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vmware.vscode-boot-dev-pack)
on the *Visual Studio Code Marketplace*.

This new application is going to be talking to a database; it's a
data-centric application. On the *Spring Initializr*, we added support
for PostgreSQL, but now we need to connect to it. The last thing we want
is a long `README.md` with a section titled, *A Hundred Easy Steps to
Development*. We want to live that *\`git clone\` & Run* life!

To that end, the Spring Initializr generated a [Docker
Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) `compose.yml` file that
contains a definition for Postgres, the amazing SQL database.

::: formalpara-title
**the Docker Compose file, `compose.yaml`**
:::

``` yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: 'postgres:latest'
    environment:
      - 'POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase'
      - 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret'
      - 'POSTGRES_USER=myuser'
    ports:
      - '5432'
```

Even better, Spring Boot is configured to automatically run the Docker
Compose (`docker compose up`) configuration when the Spring Boot
application starts up. No need to configure connectivity details like
`spring.datasource.url` and `spring.datasource.password`, etc. It's all
done with Spring Boot's amazing autoconfiguration. Ya love to see it!
And, never wanting to leave a mess, Spring Boot will shut down the
Docker containers on application shutdown, too.

We want to move as quickly as possible. To that end, we selected
DevTools on the *Spring Initializr*. It'll allow us to move quickly. The
core conceit here is that restarting Java is pretty slow. Restarting
Spring, however, is really quick. So, what if we had a process
monitoring our project folder, and that could take note of newly
compiled `.class` files, load them into the classloader, and then create
a new Spring `ApplicationContext`, discarding the old one, and giving us
the appearance of a live reload? That's exactly what Spring's DevTools
do. Run it during development and see your restart time diminish by huge
fractions!

This works because, again, Spring is super quick to startup...​ *Except*,
that is, when you are launching a PostgreSQL database on each restart. I
love PostgreSQL, but, uh, yeah, it's not meant to be constantly
restarted each time you're tweaking method names, modifying HTTP
endpoint paths, or finessing some CSS. So, let's configure Spring Boot
to simply start the Docker Compose file, and to leave it running instead
of restarting each time.

::: formalpara-title
**add the property to `application.properties`**
:::

``` properties
spring.docker.compose.lifecycle-management=start_only
```

We'll start with a simple record.

``` java
package com.example.service;

import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;

// look mom, no Lombok!
record Customer(@Id Integer id, String name) {
}
```

I love Java records! And you should too! Don't sleep on records. This
innocuous little `record` isn't just a better way to do something like
Lombok's `@Data` annotation does, it's actually part of a handful of
features that, culminating in Java 21 and taken together, support
something called *data-oriented programming*.

Java language architect Brian Goetz talks about this in his [InfoQ
article on Data-Oriented
Programming](https://www.infoq.com/articles/data-oriented-programming-java/)
in 2022.

Java has dominated the world of the monolith, the reasoning goes,
because of its strong access control, good and quick compiler, privacy
protections, and so on. Java makes it easy to create relatively modular,
composable, monolithic applications. Monolithic applications are
typically large, sprawling codebases, and Java supports it. Indeed, if
you want modularity and want to structure your large monolithic codebase
well, check out the [Spring
Modulith](https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith) project.

But things have changed. These days, the vector by which we express
change in a system these days is *not* the specialized implementations
of deep-seated hierarchies of abstract types (through dynamic dispatch
and polymorphism), but instead in terms of the often ad-hoc messages
that get sent across the wire, via HTTP/REST, gRPC, messaging substrates
like Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ, etc. It's the data, dummy!

Java has evolved to support these new patterns. Let's take a look at
four key features - records, pattern matching, smart switch expressions,
and sealed types - to see what I mean. Suppose we work in a heavily
regulated industry, like finance.

Imagine we have an interface called `Loan`. Obviously, loans are heavily
regulated financial instruments. We don't want somebody coming along and
adding an anonymous inner class implementation of the `Loan` interface,
sidestepping the validation and protection we've worked so earnestly to
build into the system.

So, we'll use `sealed` types. Sealed types are a new sort of access
control or visibility modifier.

``` java
package com.example.service;

sealed interface Loan permits SecuredLoan, UnsecuredLoan {

}

record UnsecuredLoan(float interest) implements Loan {
}

final class SecuredLoan implements Loan {

}
```

In the example, we're explicitly stipulating that there are two
implementations of `Loan` in the system: `SecuredLoan` and
`UnsecuredLoan`. Classes are open for subclassing by default, which
violates the guarantees implied by a sealed hierarchy. So, we explicitly
make the `SecuredLoan` `final`. The `UnsecuredLoan` is implemented as a
record, and is implicitly final.

Records are Java's answer to tuples. They are tuples. It's just that
Java is a nominal language: **things have names**. This tuple has a
name, too: `UnsecuredLoan`. Records give us a lot of power if we agree
to the contract they imply. The core conceit of records is that the
identity of the object is equal to the identity of the fields, they're
called \'components\', in a record. So in this case, the identity of the
record is equal to the identity of the `interest` variable. If we agree
to that, then the compiler can give us a constructor, it can give us
storage for each of the components, it can give us a `toString` method,
a `hashCode` method, and an `equals` method. And it'll give us accessors
for the components in the constructor. Nice! *And*, it supports
destructuring! The language knows how to extract out the state for the
record.

Now, let's say I wanted to display a message for each type of `Loan`.
I'll code up a method. Here's the naïve first implementation.

``` java
 @Deprecated
    String badDisplayMessageFor(Loan loan) {
        var message = "";
        if (loan instanceof SecuredLoan) {
            message = "good job! ";
        }
        if (loan instanceof UnsecuredLoan) {
            var usl = (UnsecuredLoan) loan;
            message = "ouch! that " + usl.interest() + "% interest rate is going to hurt!";
        }
        return message;
    }
```

This works, sort of. But it's not carrying its weight.

We can clean it up. Let's take advantage of pattern matching, like this:

``` java
 @Deprecated
    String notGreatDisplayMessageFor(Loan loan) {
        var message = "";
        if (loan instanceof SecuredLoan) {
            message = "good job! ";
        }
        if (loan instanceof UnsecuredLoan usl) {
            message = "ouch! that " + usl.interest() + "% interest rate is going to hurt!";
        }
        return message;
    }
```

Better. Note that we're using pattern matching to match the shape of the
object and then extract the definitively cast-able thing into a
variable, `usl`. We don't even really need the `usl` variable, though,
do we. Instead, we want to dereference the `interest` variable. So we
can change the pattern matching to extract that variable, like this.

``` java
 @Deprecated
    String notGreatDisplayMessageFor(Loan loan) {
        var message = "";
        if (loan instanceof SecuredLoan) {
            message = "good job! ";
        }
        if (loan instanceof UnsecuredLoan(var interest) ) {
            message = "ouch! that " + interest + "% interest rate is going to hurt!";
        }
        return message;
    }
```

What happens if I comment out one of the branches? Nothing! The compiler
doesn't care. We're not handling one of the critical paths through which
this code could pass.

Likewise, I have this value stored in a variable, `message`, and I'm
assigning it as a side effect of some condition. Wouldn't it be nice if
I could cut out the intermediate value and just return some expression?
Let's look at a cleaner implementation using smart switch expressions,
another nifty novelty in Java.

``` java
 String displayMessageFor(Loan loan) {
        return switch (loan) {
            case SecuredLoan sl -> "good job! ";
            case UnsecuredLoan(var interest) -> "ouch! that " + interest + "% interest rate is going to hurt!";
        };
    }
```

This version uses smart switch expressions to return a value and pattern
matching. If you comment out one of the branches, the compiler will
bark, because - thanks to sealed types - it knows that you haven't
exhausted all possible options. Nice! The compiler is doing a lot of
work for us! The result is both cleaner and more expressive. Mostly.

So, back to our regularly scheduled programming. Add an interface for
the Spring Data JDBC repository and a Spring MVC controller class. Then
start the application up. Notice that this takes an exceedingly long
period of time! That's because behind the scenes, it's using the Docker
daemon to start up the PostgreSQL instance.

But henceforth, we're going to use Spring Boot's `DevTools`. You only
need to recompile. If the app is running, and you're using Eclipse or
Visual Studio Code, you will only need to save the file: CMD+S on a
macOS. IntelliJ IDEA doesn't have a `Save` option; force a build with
CMD+Shift+F9 on macOS. Nice.

Alright, we've got our HTTP web endpoint babysitting a database, but
there's nothing in the database, so this will fail, surely. Let's
initialize our database with some schema and some sample data.

Add `schema.sql` and `data.sql`.

::: formalpara-title
**the DDL for our application, `schema.sql`**
:::

``` java
create table if not exists customer  (
    id serial primary key ,
    name text not null
) ;
```

::: formalpara-title
**some sample data for the application, `data.sql`**
:::

``` java
delete from customer;
insert into customer(name) values ('Josh') ;
insert into customer(name) values ('Madhura');
insert into customer(name) values ('Jürgen') ;
insert into customer(name) values ('Olga');
insert into customer(name) values ('Stéphane') ;
insert into customer(name) values ('Dr. Syer');
insert into customer(name) values ('Dr. Pollack');
insert into customer(name) values ('Phil');
insert into customer(name) values ('Yuxin');
insert into customer(name) values ('Violetta');
```

Make sure to tell Spring Boot to run the SQL files on startup by adding
the following property to `application.properties`:

``` properties
spring.sql.init.mode=always
```

Reload the application: CMD+Shift+F9, on macOS. On my computer, that
reload is about 1/3rd the time, or 66% less, than it takes to restart
both the JVM and the application itself. Huge.

It's up and running. Visit `http://localhost:8080/customers` to see the
results. It worked! Of course, it worked. It was a demo. It was always
going to work.

This is all pretty stock standard stuff. You could've done something
similar ten years ago. Mind you, the code would've been far more
verbose. Java's improved by leaps and bounds since then. And of course,
the speeds wouldn't have been comparable. And of course, the
abstractions are better now. But you could've done something similar - a
web application babysitting a database.

Things change. There are always new frontiers. Right now, the new
frontier is **Artificial Intelligence**, or AI. AI: because the search
for good ol\' **Intelligence** clearly wasn't hard enough.

AI is a huge industry, but what most people mean when they think of AI
is *leveraging* AI. You don't need to use Python to use Large Language
Models (LLMs), in the same way that most folks don't need to use C to
use SQL databases. You just need to integrate with the LLMs, and here
Java is second to none for choice and power.

At our last tentpole [SpringOne](https://springone.io/history-of-spring)
developer event, in 2023, we announced [**Spring
AI**](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai), a new project that aims to
make integrating and working with AI as easy as possible.

You'll want to ingest data, say from an account, files, services, or
even a set of PDFs. You'll want to store them for easy retrieval in a
vector database to support similarity searches. And you'll want to then
integrate with an LLM, giving it data from that vector database.

Sure, there are client bindings for any of the LLMs that you could
possibly want - [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/),
[Azure
OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service),
[Google Vertex](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest)
*and* [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview),
[Ollama](https://ollama.com), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co), and
of course [OpenAI](https://openai.com) itself, but that's *just the
beginning*.

All the knowledge that powers an LLM is baked into a model, and that
model then informs the LLM's understanding of the world. But that model
has an expiry date, of sorts, after which its knowledge is stale. If the
model was built two weeks ago it won't know about something that
happened yesterday. So if you want to build, say, an automated assistant
that fields requests from users about their bank accounts, then that LLM
is going to need to be apprised of the up-to-date state of the world
when it does so.

You can add information in the request that you make and use it as
context to inform the response. If it were only this simple, then that
wouldn't be so bad. There's another wrinkle. Different LLMs support
different *token window sizes*. The token window determines how much
data can you send and receive for a given request. The smaller the
window, the less information you can send, and the less informed the LLM
will be in its response.

One thing you might do here is to put the data in a vector store, like
[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector),
[Neo4j](https://neo4j.org), [Weaviate](http://weaviate.io), or
otherwise, and then connect your LLM to that vector database. Vector
stores give you the ability to, given a word or sets of words, find
other things that are similar to them. It stores data as mathematical
representations and lets you query for similar things.

This whole process of ingesting, enriching, analyzing and digesting data
to inform the response from an LLM is called **Retrieval Augmented
Generation** (RAG), Spring AI supports all of it. For more, see this
[Spring Tips video I did on Spring
AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNKDoiOUo9M). We're not going to
leverage all these capabilities here, however. Just one.

We added `OpenAI` support on the Spring Initializr so Spring AI is
already on the classpath. Add a new controller, like this:

::: formalpara-title
**an AI-powered Spring MVC controller**
:::

``` java
package com.example.service;

import org.springframework.ai.chat.ChatClient;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;

import java.util.Map;

@Controller
@ResponseBody
class StoryController {

    private final ChatClient singularity;

    StoryController(ChatClient singularity) {
        this.singularity = singularity;
    }

    @GetMapping("/story")
    Map<String, String> story() {
        var prompt = """
                Dear Singularity,

                Please write a story about the good folks of San Francisco, capital of all things Artificial Intelligence,
                and please do so in the style of famed children's author Dr. Seuss.

                Cordially,
                Josh Long
                """;
        var reply = this.singularity.call(prompt);
        return Map.of("message", reply);
    }

}
```

Pretty straightforward! Inject Spring AI's `ChatClient`, use it to send
a request to the LLM, get the response, and return it as JSON to the
HTTP client.

You'll need to configure your connection to OpenAI's API with a
property, `spring.ai.openai.api-key=`. I exported it as an environment
variable, `SPRING_AI_OPENAI_API_KEY`, before I ran the program. I won't
reproduce my key here. Forgive me for not leaking my API credential.

CMD+Shift+F9 to reload the application, and then visit the endpoint:
`http://localhost:8080/story`. The LLM might take a few seconds to
produce a response, so get that cup of coffee, glass of water, or
whatever, ready for a quick but satisfying sip.

There it is! We live in an age of miracles! The age of the freaking
singularity! You can do anything now.

But it did take a few seconds, didn't it? I don't begrudge the computer
that time! It did a splendid job! I couldn't do that any faster. Just
look at the story it generated! It's a work of art.

But it did take a while. And that has scalability implications for our
applications. Behind the scenes when we make a call to our LLM, we're
making a network call. Somewhere, deep in the bowels of the code,
there's a `java.net.Socket` from which we've obtained a
`java.io.InputStream` that represents the `byte[]` data coming from the
service. I don't know if you remember using `InputStream` directly.
Here's an example:

``` java
    try (var is = new FileInputStream("afile.txt")) {
        var next = -1;
        while ((next = is.read()) != -1) {
            next = is.read();
            // do something with read
        }
    }
```

See that part where we read bytes in from the `InputStream` by calling
`InputStream.read`? We call that a **blocking operation**. If we call
`InputStream.read` on line four, then we must wait until the call
returns until we can get to line five.

What if the service to which we're connecting simply returns too much
data? What if the service is down? What if it never returns? What if
we're stuck, waiting, in perpetuity? *What if*?

This is *tedious* if it only happens once. But it's an existential
threat for our services if it can happen on every thread in the system
used to handle HTTP requests. This happens a lot. It's the reason why
it's possible to log in to an otherwise unresponsive HTTP service and
find that the CPU is basically asleep - idle! - doing absolutely nothing
or little at all. All the threads in the thread pool are stuck in a wait
state waiting for something that's not coming.

This is a huge waste of the valuable CPUs capacity we have paid for. And
the best-case scenario is still not good. Even if the method will
eventually return, it still means that the thread on which that request
is being handled is unavailable to anything else in the system. The
method is monopolizing that thread so nobody else in the system can use
it. This wouldn't be an issue if threads were cheap and abundant. But
they're not. For most of Java's lifetime, each new thread was paired one
to one with an operating system thread. And it was not cheap. There's a
certain amount of bookkeeping associated with each thread. One to two
megabytes. So you won't be able to create many threads, and you're
wasting what few threads you do have. The horror! Who needs sleep
anyway?

There's got to be a better way.

You can use non-blocking IO. Things like the hemorrhoid-inducing and
complex Java NIO library. This is an option, in the same way that living
with a family of skunks is an option: it stinks! Most of us don't think
in terms of non-blocking IO, or regular IO, anyway. We live at higher
rungs on the abstraction ladder. We could use reactive programming. I
*love* reactive programming. I even wrote a book about it - *Reactive
Spring*\[<https://reactivespring.io>\]. But it's not exactly obvious how
to make that work if you're not used to thinking like a functional
programmer. It's a different paradigm and implies a rewrite of your
code.

What if we could have our non-blocking cake and eat it too? With [Java
21](https://openjdk.org), now we can! There's a new feature called
virtual threads that makes this stuff a ton easier! If you do something
blocking on one of these new *virtual threads*, the runtime will detect
that you're doing a blocking thing - like `java.io.InputStream.read`,
`java.io.OutputStream.write`, and `java.lang.Thread.sleep` - and move
that blocking, idle activity off of the thread and into RAM. Then, it'll
basically set an egg timer for sleep, or monitor the file descriptor for
IO, and let the runtime repurpose the thread for something else in the
meantime. When the blocking action has finished, the runtime moves it
back onto a thread and lets it continue from where it started, all with
almost no changes to your code. It's hard to understand, so let's look
at it by way of an example. I shamelessly *borrowed* this example from
Oracle Developer Advocate [José
Paumard](https://twitter.com/josepaumard).

**this example demonstrates creating 1,000 threads and sleeping for 400
milliseconds on each one, while noting the name of the first of those

            Thread.sleep(100);

            // dedupe elements with Set<T>
            var names = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<String>();

            // merci José Paumard d'Oracle
            for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                var first = 0 == i;
                threads.add(Thread.ofPlatform().unstarted(() -> run(first, names)));
            }

            for (var t : threads)
                t.start();

            for (var t : threads)
                t.join();

            System.out.println(names);
        };
    }

}
```

We're using the `Thread.ofPlatform` factory method to create regular
ol\' platform threads, identical in nature to the threads we've created
basically since Java's debut in the 1990's. The program creates 1,000
threads. In each thread, we sleep for 100 milliseconds, four times. In
between, we test if we're on the first of the 1000 threads, and if we
are, we note the current thread's name by adding it to a set. A set
dedupes its elements; if the same name appears more than once, there'll
still only be one element in the set.

Run the program (CMD+Shift+F9!) and you'll see that the physics of the
program are unchanged. There is only one name in the `Set<String>`. Why
wouldn't there be? We only tested the same thread, over and over.

Now, change that constructor to use *virtual threads*:
`Thread.ofVirtual`. Super easy change. And now run the program.
CMD+Shift+F9.

You'll see that there is more than one element in the set. You didn't
change the core logic of your code at all. And indeed you only even had
to change *one* thing, but now, seamlessly, behind the scenes, the
compiler and the runtime rewrote your code so that when something
blocking happens on a virtual thread, the runtime seamlessly takes you
off and puts you back on threads after the blocking thing has concluded.
This means that the thread on which you existed before is now available
to other parts of the system. Your scalability is going to go through
the roof!

And you might protest, well I don't want to have to change all my code.
First, that's a ridiculous argument, the change is trivial. You might
protest: I don't want to be in the business of creating threads, either.
Good point. Tony Hoare, in the 1970's, wrote that `NULL` is the 1
billion dollar mistake. He was wrong. It was, in fact, PHP. But, he also
spoke at length about how untenable it was to build systems using
threading. You're going to want to work with higher order abstractions,
like sagas, actors, or at the very least an `ExecutorService`.

And there's a new virtual thread executor as well:
`Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor`. Nice! If you're using
Spring Boot, it's trivial to override the default bean of that type for
use in parts of the system. Spring Boot will pull that in and defer to
it instead. Easy enough. But if you're using Spring Boot 3.2 You are,
surely, using Spring Boot 3.2, right? You realize that each release is
only support for like a year, right? Make sure to check out an given
[Spring projects\' support
policy](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support). If you are
using 3.2, then you need only add one property to
`application.properties` and we'll plugin the virtual thread support for
you.

``` properties
spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true
```

Nice! No code changes required. And now you should see much improved
scalability, and might be able to scale down some of the instances in
your load balancer, if your services are IO bound. My suggestion? Tell
your boss you're gonna save the company a ton of cash but insist you
want that money in your paycheck. Then deploy this change. Voilà!

Alright, we're moving quickly. We've got `git clone` & run-ability.
We've got Docker compose support. We've got DevTools. We have a very
nice language and syntax. We've got the freaking singularity. We're
moving quickly. We've got scalability. Add the Spring Boot Actuator to
the build and now you've got observability. I think it's time we turned
to production.

I wanna package this application up and make it as efficient as
possible. Here, my friends, there are a couple of things we need to
consider. First of all, how do we containerize the application? Simple.
Use [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io). Easy. Remember, friends don't
let friends write Dockerfiles. Use Buildpacks. They're supported out of
the box with Spring Boot, too: `./gradlew buildBootImage` or
`./mvnw spring-boot:build-image`. This isn't new though, so next
question.

How do we get this thing to be as efficient and optimized as possible?
And before we dive into this, my friends, it's important to remember
that Java is already very very very efficient. I love [this
blog](https://thenewstack.io/which-programming-languages-use-the-least-electricity/)
from 2018, before the COVID pandemic, or *BC*.

It looks at which languages use the least energy, or are the most
energy-efficient. C is the most energy-efficient. It uses the least
electricity. 1.0. It's the baseline. It's efficient...​ for **MACHINES**.
Not people! Definitely, *not* people.

Then we have Rust and its zero-cost abstractions. Well done.

Then we have C++...​

![gross](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshlong-attic/bootiful-spring-boot-2024-blog/main/service/images/gross.gif)

C++ is disgusting! Moving on...​

Then we have the Ada language, but.. who cares?

And then we have Java, which is nearly 2.0. Let's just round up and say
2.0. Java is two times - twice! - as inefficient as C. Or one half as
efficient as C.

So far so good? Great. It's in the top 5 most efficient languages,
though!

If you scroll the list, you'll see some amazing numbers. Go and C#
coming in around the 3.0+ range. Scroll down here, and we have
JavaScript and TypeScript, one of which - to my endless bafflement - is
four times *less* efficient than the other!

Then we have PHP and Hack, the less said about which the better. Moving
on!

Then we have JRuby and Ruby. Friends, remember
[JRuby](https://www.jruby.org) is
[Ru\[by](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), written in Java. And Ruby is
Ruby, written in C. And yet JRuby is almost a one third more efficient
than Ruby! Just by dint of having been written in Java, and running on
the JVM. The JVM is an amazing piece of kit. Absolutely phenomenal.

Then.. we have Python. And this, well this makes me very sad indeed! I
*love* Python! I've been using Python since the 1990's! Bill Clinton was
president when I first learned Python! But these numbers are *not*
great. Think about it. 75.88. Let's round up to 76. I'm not great at
math. But you know what is? Freakin\' Python! Let's ask it.

![python doing
math](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshlong-attic/bootiful-spring-boot-2024-blog/main/service/images/python-doing-math.png)

38! That means that if you ran a program in Java, and the generation of
the energy required to run it creates a bit of carbon that ends up
trapped in the atmosphere, raising the temperature, and that heightened
temperature in turn kills ONE tree, then the equivalent program in
Python would kill THIRTY-EIGHT trees! That's a forest! That's worse than
Bitcoin! We need to do something about this, and soon. I don't know
what, but something.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that Java is already *amazing*. I
think this is because of two things that people take for granted:
garbage collection and the Just In Time (JIT) compiler.

Garbage collection, well we all know what it is. Heck, [even the White
House appreciates garbage-collected, memory-safe
languages](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Final-ONCD-Technical-Report.pdf)
like Java in its recent report on securing software to secure the
building blocks of cyberspace.

The Java programming language garbage collector lets us write mediocre
software and sort of *get away* with it. It's dope! That said, I do take
issue with the notion that it is the *original* Java garbage collector!
That honor belongs elsewhere, like perhaps [with
Jesslyn](https://twitter.com/jtannady/status/981547257479778307?lang=en).

And the JIT is another amazing piece of kit. It analyses frequently
accessed code paths in your application and turns them into operating
system and architecture-specific native code. It can only do this for
some of your code though. It needs to know that the types that are in
play when you compile the code are the only types that will be in play
when you run the code. And some things in Java - a very dynamic language
with a runtime that's more akin to that of JavaScript, Ruby, and
Python - allow Java programs to do things that would violate this
constraint. Things like serialization, JNI, reflection, resource
loading, and JDK proxies. Remember, it's possible, with Java, to have a
`String` that has as its contents a Java source code file, compile that
string into a `.class` file on the filesystem, load the `.class` file
into the `ClassLoader`, reflectively create an instance of that class,
and then - if that class is an interface - to create a JDK proxy of that
class. And if that class implements `java.io.Serializable`, it's
possible to write that class instance over a network socket and load it
on another JVM. And you can do all of that without ever having an
explicit typed reference to anything beyond `java.lang.Object`! It's an
amazing language, and this dynamic nature makes it a very productive
language. It also frustrates the JIT's attempt at optimizations.

Still, the JIT does an amazing job where it can. And the results speak
for themselves. So, one wonders: why couldn't we proactively JIT the
whole program? Ahead of time? And we can. There's an OpenJDK
distribution called [GraalVM](https://graalvm.org) that has a number of
niceties that extend the OpenJDK release with extra tools like the
`native-image` compiler. The native image compiler is dope. But this
native image compiler has the same constraints. It can't do its magic
for very dynamic things. Which is a problem. As most code - your unit
testing libraries, your web frameworks, your ORMs, your logging
libraries... everything! - use one or all of those dynamic behaviors.

There is an escape hatch. You can furnish configuration in the form of
`.json` files to the GraalVM compiler in a well-known directory:
`src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/$groupId/$artifactId/\*.json`.
These `.json` files have two problems.

First, the word \"JSON\" sounds stupid. I don't like saying the word
\"JAY-SAWN\". As an adult, I can't believe we say these things to each
other. I speak French, and in French, you'd pronounce it *jeeesã*. So,
`.gison`. Much nicer. The Hokkien language has a word - *gingsong*
(happiness), which also could work. So you could have .gingsong. Pick
your team! Either way, `.json` should not stand. I'm team `.gison`, but
it doesn't matter.

The second problem is that, well, there's just so much darned of it
that's required! Again, just think about all the places where your
programs do these fun, dynamic things like reflection, serialization,
JDK proxies, resource loading, and JNI! It's endless. Your web
frameworks. Your testing libraries. Your data access technologies. I
don't have time to write artisanal, handcrafted configuration files for
every program. I don't even have enough time to finish this blog!

So, instead, we'll use the Spring Boot ahead-of-time (AOT) engine
introduced in 3.0. The AOT engine analyses the beans in your Spring
application and emits the requisite configuration files for you. Nice!
There's even a whole component model that you can use that extends
Spring to compile time. I won't get into all of that here, but you can
read my [free
e-book](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/white-papers/spring-boot-3) or
watch my free YouTube video introducing all things [Spring and
AOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOfYlLjXufw). It's basically the
same content, just different ways to consume it.

So let's kick off that build with Gradle, `./gradlew nativeCompile`, or
`./mvnw -Pnative native:compile` if you're using Apache Maven. You might
want to skip tests on this one...​ This build will take a little while.
Remember, it's doing an analysis of everything in your codebase - be it
the libraries on the classpath, the JRE, and the classes in your code
itself - to determine which types it should preserve and which it should
throw out. The result is a lean, mean, lightning-fast runtime machine,
but at the cost of a very, *very* slow compilation time.

It takes so long, in fact, that it kinda just gums up my flow. It stops
me dead in my tracks, waiting. I am like the platform threads from
earlier on, in this very blog: *blocked*! I get bored. Waiting. Waiting.
I now finally understand this [famous XKCD
cartoon](https://xkcd.com/303/).

Sometimes I start to hum music. Or theme songs. Or elevator music. You
know what [elevator music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_music)
sounds like, right? Ceaseless, endless. So, I thought, wouldn't it be
great if everyone heard elevator music, as well? [So I
asked](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/5327). I got some great
responses.

One suggested, from our friend that we should play this elevator music
from the soundtrack to the Nintendo 64 video game to the first Pierce
Brosnan outing as James Bond, *Goldeneye*. I like it.

<figcaption><em>Goldeneye</em> had some amazing elevator
music!</figcaption>

One response suggested that having a beeping sound would be useful.
Couldn't agree more. My stupid microwave will make a *ding!* sound when
it's done. Why couldn't my multi-million line compiler?

</figure>

And then we got this response, from another one of my favorite doctors,
[Dr. Niephaus](https://twitter.com/fniephaus), who works on the GraalVM
team. He said that adding elevator music would only just fix the
symptoms, and not the cause of the problem, which is making GraalVM even
more efficient in terms of time and memory.

![doctor
niephaus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshlong-attic/bootiful-spring-boot-2024-blog/main/service/images/doctor-niephaus.png)

Ok. But he did share this promising prototype!

![graalvm
prototype](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshlong-attic/bootiful-spring-boot-2024-blog/main/service/images/graalvm-prototype.png)

I'm sure it'll get merged any day now...​

Anyway! If you check the compilation, it should be done now. It's in the
`./build/native/nativeCompile/` folder, and it's called `service`. On my
machine, the compilation took 52 seconds. Yeesh!

Run it. It'll fail because, again, we're living that `git clone` & run
lifestyle! We didn't specify any connectivity credentials! So, run it
with environment variables specifying your SQL database connectivity
details. Here's the script I used on my Machine. This will work only on
a Unix-flavored operating system, and works for either Maven or Gradle.

``` shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

export SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/mydatabase
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=secret
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=myuser

SERVICE=.
MVN=$SERVICE/target/service
GRADLE=$SERVICE/build/native/nativeCompile/service
ls -la $GRADLE && $GRADLE || $MVN
```

On my machine, it starts up in \~100 milliseconds! Like a rocket! And,
obviously, it would be much faster still if I were using something like
Spring Cloud Function to build AWS Lamba-style functions-as-a-service,
because I wouldn't need for example to package an HTTP server. Indeed,
if pure startup speed were *all* that I really wanted, then I might even
use Spring's amazing support for [Project
CRaC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMhpDdR6nHw&t=2658s). That's
neither here no there. I don't really care all that much about that
because this is a standalone, long-lived service. What I care about is
the resource usage, as represented by the [Resident Set Size
(RSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). Note the process identifier
(PID) - it'll be in the logs. If the PID is, let's say, `55`, then get
the RSS like this using the `ps` utility, available on virtually all
Unixes:

``` shell
ps -o rss 55
```

It'll dump out a number in kilobytes; divide by a thousand and you'll
get the number in megabytes. On my machine, it takes just over 100MB to
run. You can't run Slack in that tiny amount of memory! I bet you've got
individual browser tabs in Chrome taking that much, or more!

So, we have a program that is as concise as can be while being easy to
develop and iterate on. And it uses virtual threads to give us
unparalleled scalability. It runs as a standalone, self-contained,
operating system and architecture-specific native image. Oh! And, it
supports the freaking singularity!

We live in an amazing time. There's never been a better time to be a
Java and Spring developer. I hope I've so persuaded you, too.
